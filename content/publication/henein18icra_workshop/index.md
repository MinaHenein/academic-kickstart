abstract: "Abstract— The  limitations  of  existing  localisation  and  mapping  algorithms  in  handling  highly  dynamic  environments  is a  key  roadblock  in  the  deployment  of  autonomous  mobile robotic  systems  in  a  range  of  important  real  world  situations. In this paper we propose a technique to integrate the motion of dynamic objects into a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm without the need to know a-priori or model the  geometry  of  the  object,  or  even  to  explicitly  estimate  the pose  of  the  object.  The  benefit  of  this  approach  lies  in  a simplification  of  the  underlying  SLAM  state  and  a  resulting simplification  of  the  non-linear  least  squares  optimisation  solution.  We  demonstrate  the  performance  of  the  algorithm  on two scenarios; SLAM in an urban traffic scenario, and extrinsic calibration of a multi RGBD camera system observing a moving object. Our experiments show consistent improvement in robot localisation  and  mapping  accuracy  and  demonstrate  potential of  the  proposed  algorithm."
